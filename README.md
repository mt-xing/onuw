Definitely not a ripoff of One Night Ultimate Werewolf. It's a totally different game whose similarities in terms of mechanics, names, or anything else, to any existing games is totally unintentional.

`npm install`

## Test
`npm start`

Test client running on `http://localhost:3000`. Server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
